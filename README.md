“A shadow lost his kid, wondering to far away from the light. Now it must find his colored equal, to become one again.”

Shadow Runner is a classic run, jump & duck game. You only need 2 buttons for gaming: one for jumping, one for sliding and you have a pause button too.

Your goal? Get as far as possible, jumping over those rocks and ducking under those low flying birds. Watch your life-bar, as it get’s empty faster and faster. If you see a heart, grab it and your life-bar will be filled completely.
